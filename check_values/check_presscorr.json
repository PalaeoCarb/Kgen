These values are consistent with parameters present in Table A.11.2 of Zeebe & Wolf-Gladrow (2001), with the exception of KW which was reported there for fresh water, K0, KSi and KPs which are assumed to be 1 (i.e. no pressure correction). All other values are calculated at an initial starting point and should be used for consistency checks in future.",
