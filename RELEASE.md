# Release Checklist for KGen

## Version numbers

Should follow X.Y.Z, where X and Y are cross-platform major and minor releases, and Z can be platform-specific bug fixes.

### Logic

- Performance across all languages will be identical at the X.Y level.
- The .Z level will be used to indicate bug fixes for a specific language, and may therefore differ between languages.

### Major/Minor Update Procedure

1. Make changes to code, commit to GitHub and ensure the test pass verifying agreement between languages.
2. Push a GitHub tag incrementing the appropriate level (i.e. `X.Y+1.0` or `X+1.Y.0`)
3. On GitHub, create a release linked to this tag, and add a description of the changes made. Also add this description to `HISTORY.md`.
4. Follow the instructions below to update the package for the language that has changed.

### Bug Fix Procedure

1. Make changes to code, and push a GitHub Tag incrementing the Z level and identifying the language that was changed, i.e. `X.Y.Z+1 - LANGUAGE`
2. On GitHub, create a release linked to this tag, and add a description of the changes made.
3. Follow the instructions below to update the package for the language that has changed.
