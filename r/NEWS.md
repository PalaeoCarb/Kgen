# kgen 0.3.0

- Migrated all relevant things to start with 'calc_' instead of 'fn_' (e.g. calc_K1 instead of fn_K1). These are not exported so have no impact on functionality.
- calc_Ks -> calc_all_Ks, calc_all_Ks gives all the K*'s, and calc_Ks must have the names of requested K*'s specified
- Added wrapper function to calculate seawater correction using Kgen

# kgen 0.2.1
